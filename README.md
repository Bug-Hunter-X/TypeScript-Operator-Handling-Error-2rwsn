# TypeScript Operator Handling Bug

This repository demonstrates a common error in TypeScript related to handling invalid operator inputs within a function. The `operate` function processes mathematical operations based on a provided operator (+, -, *, /). However, it lacks robust error handling and support for additional operators. The bug is shown in `bug.ts`, while the improved version with enhanced error handling and extended operator functionality is in `bugSolution.ts`.
